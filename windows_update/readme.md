# Updating Windows and Microsoft Updates at Startup

You can set up a PowerShell script to check for and install Windows updates at startup by using the following steps:
Open Windows PowerShell as an administrator. To do this, right-click the Windows PowerShell shortcut and select "Run as administrator."
Copy and paste the script called "Check for and install Windows updates" into the PowerShell window
Save the script as a .ps1 file on your computer, for example: "CheckForUpdates.ps1".

To run this script at startup, you can add a shortcut to the script in the Windows Startup folder. To do this, follow these steps:
1. Open the Start menu and type "shell:startup" into the search box.
2. Right-click the Startup folder that appears in the search results and select "Open."
3. Right-click inside the Startup folder and select "New" > "Shortcut."
4. In the "Create Shortcut" dialog, type the following command from "Linking the startup script". Replacing "C:\path\to\CheckForUpdates.ps1" with the actual path to your script on your computer.
4. Click "Next" and give the shortcut a name, such as "Check for Updates."
5. Click "Finish."

Now, each time the computer starts up, the PowerShell script will run and check for and install any available Windows updates. 

Note that the script will require administrator privileges to run, so you may be prompted to enter your admin credentials.

To automate the opening of PowerShell in administrative privileges, you can create a shortcut to PowerShell and then set the shortcut to run as an administrator. Here's how:
1. Right-click the Windows desktop and select "New" > "Shortcut."
2. In the "Create Shortcut" dialog, type the following command: powershell.exe
3. Click "Next" and give the shortcut a name, such as "Windows PowerShell (Admin)."
4. Right-click the new shortcut and select "Properties."
5. In the Properties window, go to the "Shortcut" tab.
6. Click the "Advanced" button.
7. Check the box for "Run as administrator."
8. Click "OK" and then "Apply" to save the changes.

Now, each time you double-click the shortcut, PowerShell will open in administrative privileges. You can then use the previously mentioned script to check for and install Windows updates at startup.
